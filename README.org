* Lame - manual task streamlining in Emacs
Lame is a framework for streamlining manual tasks.
The idea is to automate what's possible and use Emacs for
all manual interaction.
Often you only have to sanity check the result or slightly modfiy
a text. Lame helps by reducing the necessary interaction to a minimum.
The whole process is automatically documented so you can easily share your
manual workflow with coworkers or keep it for reference.

All lame really is, is a bunch of macros to define a chain of steps.
Each step is automatically documented and can execute some arbitrary code.
There are a couple of convenience functions for quickly writing new tasks.

A demo of lame is available via =(lame/demo)=.
